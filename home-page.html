			<p><b>What does a "Day-in-the-Life" look like? </b></p>
			<p>Equipped with a company vehicle and excellent industry training, Pest Techs are out in the areas Terminix serves visiting customers and performing their pest control treatments. Pest Technicians also offer customers on their route additional
				products and services that may be beneficial, which presents a great opportunity to earn commissions on top of a very attractive base salary.</p>
			<p>Here are a few more specifics of what you would be doing each day:</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<p><b>What do I need to be successful? </b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Being a high school graduate/having a GED and a valid driver’s license are both requirements</li>

				<li>You are personable and enjoy interacting with customers</li>
				<li>You are self-motivated and have a strong work ethic</li>
				<li>You can effectively present information to customers one-on-one and in small groups</li>
				<li>You are detailed oriented and understand the importance of safety</li>
				<li>You have a good aptitude for basic math-- necessary for doing calculations related to sales and service</li>
				<li>Of course, given our business, you should be comfortable working outside and in confined spaces</li>
				<li>For safety reasons (rebreathers have to be able to seal to your face) our Pest Techs aren’t able to have facial hair</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Why should I choose Terminix? </b></p>
			<p>In addition to being part of an iconic brand with a rich 85 year history, here are some other highlights of what we offer members of the Terminix Team.</p>
